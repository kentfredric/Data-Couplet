Revision history for Data-Couplet

0.02004314 2011-10-28T14:54:15Z
 [Dependencies]
 - changed: runtime requires Moose 0.84 -> 0.90
 - dropped: runtime requires MooseX::Has::Sugar

 [Features]
 - Added (private) accessors for everything moose can do on the ::Private
   core. This is soley to discourage consumers from accesing the hash
   internals directly to provide better encapsulation. Maybe one day
   ::Private will be entirely replaced with XS and you want it to remain
   working.
 - Added a basic Type Library, Data::Couplet::Types
